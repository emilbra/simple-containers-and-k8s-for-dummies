## Podman

While Docker is well known for many, and is in large parts responsible for the the advances in containerization, we will make use of  [Podman](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/index.html) as our container runtime and build tool for this tutorial.

Podman is free and easy to use. The workflow attached to Containers and Container images will remain the same regardless of the specific tooling you use. Podman actually goes as far as claiming that many users could simply alias "Docker" to "podman", and run commands as they would with Docker.
